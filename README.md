# Ethics-Game

An online interactive storybook and educational game that teaches young children the ethics of bioengineering. This ethics based game takes the user on a journey with a crew of scientists who are exploring and studying deep sea creatures. Along the way, the user meets an anglerfish with a lure that is unable to light up and is faced with the choice of bioengineering the lure to light up or not. What follows are a series of questions and dilemmas that highlight the ethical challenges posed by bioengineering technology, and the unforseen consequences it may have.

This game was designed, prototyped and made by the Tangibac team at the <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/">Wellesley HCI Lab</a>, using the <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser<a> game engine.
